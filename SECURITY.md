# Security Policy

## Reporting a vulnerability
If you discover a security vulnerability in this project, please report it privately by emailing **security@angisoft.co.ke** with the subject line "[angisoft.co.ke] Security vulnerability" and include as much detail as possible (steps to reproduce, affected versions, and any suggested fixes).

Please do not open a public issue or disclose the vulnerability publicly before we have had a chance to address it.

## Response
We will acknowledge receipt within 48 hours and work to provide a fix or mitigation as quickly as possible.

## Supported versions
Use the repository's tags and releases to determine which versions are supported. If your report affects a supported release, we will coordinate a disclosure once a fix is available.

## Credit
If you would like to be credited for responsibly reporting a vulnerability, please mention how you would like your name to appear in the disclosure email.
